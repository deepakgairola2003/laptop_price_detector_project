# laptop_price_detector_project
This repository contain the project that I made for predicting the laptop price using Random Forest Model
I first did lots of data preprocessing as the data was not structured using EDA techniques.
Then I tried different Regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, xgboost although the jupyter notebook file contain code for Random Forest only as it provided the best accuracy scores.
I have tried to deploy the model also but I was unable to do so due to some error in the main file but I will surely try deploying it later.
